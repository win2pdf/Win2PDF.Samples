This flow converts a folder of Microsoft Excel .XLSX files to PDF using the Win2PDF printer. The PDF files are placed in the same folder as the .XLSX files, but with a .PDF extension.  A more detailed description is in the [Win2PDF user guide](https://www.win2pdf.com/doc/excel-to-pdf-power-automate-desktop.html).

To use the sample, copy the text and paste it into a new flow in Power Automate Desktop.
