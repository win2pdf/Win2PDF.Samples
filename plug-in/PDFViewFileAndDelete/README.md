# View a PDF file created by Win2PDF using the system default PDF viewer, and then automatically delete it when the viewer is closed

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to automatically view newly created PDF files created by Win2PDF with the system default PDF viewer. It automatically deletes the PDF when the viewer is closed. This can be used with the Win2PDF Auto-name feature to create a print preview for legacy applications.

You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/Win2PDF-View-File-Plug-In.exe

The Win2PDFViewFile.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in.

The plug-in requries that [Win2PDF](https://www.win2pdf.com/download/download.htm) is installed. Contact support@win2pdf.com for a time limited evaluation license.
