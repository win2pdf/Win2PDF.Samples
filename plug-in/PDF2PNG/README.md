# Automatically convert PDF files created by Win2PDF to PNG format with a configurable resolution

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to automatically convert a newly created PDF to a PNG file with a configurable resolution. After the PDF is converted to PNG, the PDF is deleted.

You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/Win2PDF-PDF2PNG-Plug-In.exe

The Win2PDF2PNG.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in.
