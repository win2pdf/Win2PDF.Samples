# View a PDF file created by Win2PDF using the system default PDF viewer

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to automatically view newly created PDF files created by Win2PDF with the system default PDF viewer. 

You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/Win2PDF-View-File-Plug-In.exe

The Win2PDFViewFile.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in. The sample does not allow a user to turn off the view file plug-in.

The plug-in requries that [Win2PDF](https://www.win2pdf.com/download/download.htm) is installed. Contact support@win2pdf.com for a time limited evaluation license.
