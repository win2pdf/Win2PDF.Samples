# Automatically convert PDF files created by Win2PDF to JPG format with a configurable resolution

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to automatically convert a newly created PDF to a JPG file with a configurable resolution. After the PDF is converted to JPG, the PDF is deleted.

You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/Win2PDF-PDF2JPG-Plug-In.exe
