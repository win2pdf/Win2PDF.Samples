# Automatically Rename a PDF Based on Content Using Conditional Searches

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to automatically rename newly created PDFs using the content within the PDF and conditional searches.

You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/Win2PDF-Conditional-Rename-Plug-In.exe

The Win2PDFConditionalRename.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in.

This plug-in uses the [Win2PDF command line](https://www.win2pdf.com/doc/win2pdf-desktop-command-line.html) to [search PDF content](https://www.win2pdf.com/doc/command-line-pdf-content-search.html) from the PDF, and requires a licensed version of [Win2PDF](https://www.win2pdf.com/download/download.htm).  Contact support@win2pdf.com for a time limited evaluation license.
