# Automatically open the PDF file save location folder after creating a file with Win2PDF

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to automatically open the saved folder in Windows Explorer after a PDF is created with Win2PDF.

You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/Win2PDF-Open-Folder-Plug-In.exe

The Win2PDFOpenFolder.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in.

The plug-in requries that [Win2PDF](https://www.win2pdf.com/download/download.htm) is installed. Contact support@win2pdf.com for a time limited evaluation license.
