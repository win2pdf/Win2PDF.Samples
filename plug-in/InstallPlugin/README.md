You can download the compiled version at: https://get.win2pdf.com/plug-in/InstallWin2PDFPlugin.exe

There is no setup program, just run the program to install a plug-in. The program will first prompt to select your plugin executable or script, and it will then prompt to select a printer associated with the plug-in. For batch convert and watch folder and convert plug-ins, you should always select "Win2PDF" as the printer.
